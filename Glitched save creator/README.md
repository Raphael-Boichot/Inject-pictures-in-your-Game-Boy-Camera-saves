This code turns any 128 kB chunck of data (even random like in this example) into a legit Game Boy Camera save. Inject random values and enjoy the weirdness of results !

I've never managed to make the camera crash with any random save injected so the beast is quite robust to arbitrary code execution. It features lots of verifications in order to not execute crap on purpose. This may indicate that the Game Boy Camera is sadly not Turing complete.
