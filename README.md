# Inject custom pictures in your Game Boy Camera saves and cheat at minigames

By RaphaÃ«l BOICHOT, May 2021, a Matlab/Octave project.

The idea comes (once again) from the Game Boy Camera Club discord - https://disboard.org/nl/server/568464159050694666.
Some informations also come from the InsideGdget Discord, https://github.com/lesserkuma/FlashGBX and https://github.com/HerrZatacke/gb-printer-web

After a discussion about the vintage Game Boy Camera advertisements (like the Funtograpy guide for example) that present screen artworks, clearly not made with D-pad only, comes the idea that a tool perhaps existed as presskit to make custom saves with pictures not coming from the camera.

So, despite the fact that extracting images from Game Boy Camera saves was made possible by fans since many years, it was virtually impossible to do the inverse : inject custom pictures into saves. At least until now. What could be the interest, dear reader ? It can be usefull to mess with pixel perfect artworks, to reuse an image that was erased long ago from camera but still stored somewhere on a computer or internet, to steal pictures from other people and claim they are yours or simply exchange pictures with friends even if you have no friends. Be creative ! 

The two small codes presented here are intended to be easy to use. Here are the steps :
- Extract your save from Game Boy Camera with any tool like this: https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/gbxcart-rw/
- Scan you save with the provided tool (slot_viewer.m) to identify memory slots available for injection ;
- prepare a 128x112 image and a 32x32 pixels thumbnail, 4 shades of gray ;  
- Inject the two pictures at once with the provided tool (image_injector.m) into any desired available memory slot ;
- Burn you modified save into the Game Boy Camera ;
- Enjoy with your old-new image.

The scanning code basically extracts and analyses values at addresses 0x011D7 to 0x011F4 that contains the state and numbering of any image slot on the save. These data are also duplicated from addresses 0x011B2 to 0x011CF. Any number between 0x00 and 0x1D on this state vector represents the image number (minus one) that shows on the cameras screen, FF is an unused slot (erased of never used). The number assignated to an image on camera is in consequence not related to the slot number (or physical address). Deleting an image on camera will simply write FF on the vector state and all images will be renumbered dynamically, but image data stay on their respective slots as long as another image is not written on it. When a picture is taken, memory slots marked as unused on the vector state will be used by writing data in priority to the lowest address one. Next image illustrates the principle of this state vector :

![Vector state](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/Inject-pictures-in-your-Game-Boy-Camera-saves/blob/main/Pictures/Vector%20state.png)

Anyway, there is a checksum system at addresses 0x011D5-0x011D6 and 0x011FA-0x011FB that precludes any possibility of un-erasing a picture by simply reversing the order of operation on the vector state. Doing this simply messes-up all the filesystem and forces the camera to self-erase vector state.

# SO

By trial-and-error I've found that an active image (not empty, not erased) could be replaced bytewise without activating any checksum issue. In consequence, the injection code targets only slots corresponding to active images and just substitutes the data corresponding to the image tiles (address range : 0xXX000-0xXXDEF for the image, address range : 0xXXDF0-0xXXEFF for the thumbnail, XX ranging from 02 to 1F). Additionnal data (range 0xXXF00-0xXXFFF), are not modified. Apart from that, data are arranged in Game Boy tile format, tile after tile, in reading order, so nothing particular for you Nintendo nerds.

Funfact, the thumbnail is dynamically rewritten each time the image is saved into the Game Boy Camera, even if just one pixel is changed. So I just provide a generic image thumbnail that will soon diseappear. 

# Research, checksums and pain

I loosely continue collecting data to understand how bytes are arranged into the savestate (see research folder). To what I understand now : 
- Address range 0x00000-0x00DEF contains FF or the last image seen by the Game Boy Camera sensor. It stays permanently in memory when Game Boy is off and can be extracted as a normal image ; 
- Frame border associated to an image is indicated at adress 0xXXFB0, XX ranging from 02 to 1F, by a single byte. This means that the border information is contains into the image data ;
- User ID (birthdate, gender and name) is embedded into image informations section (but not in clear), address range 0xXXFB0-0xXXFF0. At fist power-up, ID data are contained in the footer of the first image (even if this image stays blank) ;
- Score at Ball is stored at address 0x010C9-0x010CA and 0x011A2-0x011A3 and modifies what seems to be a checksum at address 0x010D7-0x10D8 and address 0x011B0-0x011B1. Score appears in clear, but in decimal, bytes reversed (a score of 170 is written 0x70, 0x01) ;
- Score at Space Fever is stored at adress 0x010C5-0x010C6 (possibly 0x010C7-0x010C8) and 0x0119E-0x0119F (possibly 0x011A0-0x011A1) and modifies the same bytes as Ball. Score appears in clear, but in decimal, bytes reversed (a score of 2034 is written 0x34, 0x20) ;
- Score at Run! Run! Run! is stored at address 0x010CB-0x010CC and 0x011A4-0x011A5 and modifies the same bytes as Ball. The value written in savestate at adress 0x010CB-0x010CC is aqual to 99 minus the digits on screen (example : 18s10' is written 0x89,0x81) ;
- Bytes 0x010BB-0x010BC and 0x01194-0x01195 seem to be image counters for pictures taken. They also modifies 0x010D7-0x10D8 and 0x011B0-0x011B1 (the score checksums) ;
- Bytes 0x010BD-0x010BE and 0x01196-0x01197 seem to be image counters for picture erased (it always increments). They also modifies 0x010D7-0x10D8 and 0x011B0-0x011B1 (the score checksums) ;
- Bytes 0x010C1-0x010C1 and 0x0119A-0x0119B seem to be image counters for picture printed (it always increments). They also modifies 0x010D7-0x10D8 and 0x011B0-0x011B1 (the score checksums) ;
- bytes 0x010BF-0x010C0 and 0x01198-0x01199 seem to be image counters for picture transfered (it always increments). They also modifies 0x010D7-0x10D8 and 0x011B0-0x011B1 (the score checksums). 
- Bytes 0x010C3, 0x119C stored the number of pictures received from males, bytes 0x010C4, 0x119D received from females ;
- bytes 0x011D6 and 0x011D6 repeated at 0x011FA and 0x11FB seem to be a checksum only related to vector state ;
- Occurences of these checksums is preceded by the word "Magic" in ascii, perhaps a kind of humor ;
- The last byte into an image slot (0xXXFFF) is not related to the image state ;
- Any discrepancy between data, scores and checksums causes the camera to erase all informations into the save at reboot (camera must consider the savestate as corrupted or modified by cheating) ;

# Summary

- Scores of minigames are stored in address range 0x010C5-0x010CC and repeated at range 0x0119E-0x011A5 ;
- Image counters are stored in range address range 0x010BB-0x010C4 and repeated at range 0x01194-0x0119D ;
- Scores and image counters are stored in decimal format by batch of two digits, least significant batch of two digits first ;
- Scores and image counters increment and decrement at the same time two checksum "bytes" at address 0x010D7-0x10D8, repeated at address 0x011B0-0x011B1 ;
- Left byte of the checksum seems to be equal to 47 + sum(left value of digits + right value of digits) by batch of two "bytes" from 0x010C5 to 0x010CC. I'm not 100% sur of the rule ;
- Right byte of the checksum seems to be equal to 63 - sum(left value of digits - right value of digits) by batch of two "bytes" from 0x010C5 to 0x010CC. I'm not 100% sur of the rule  ;  
- The vector states (0x011D7 to 0x011F4) seem to have their own independant checksum bytes at adresses 0x011D5-0x11D6, repeated at 0x011FA-0x011FB ;
- left byte of the checksum seems to be equal to 11 + sum(image number in the vector state + 1, FF excluded) ; 
- calculation of the right byte of the checksum is not understood to me for the moment. It is the sum or difference of something, but what ?
- The data corresponding to picture stored in camera are not protected by any way ;
- I suppose all of this was implemented as some Game Genie or other cheating hardware counter measure as it is twisted as hell ;
- Good new, Pocket Camera and Game Boy Camera seems to have the same save structure. They are fully intercompatibles.
- I suppose some additionnal work would be necessary to make a proper dedicated cheating tool.

# Pimp your save !

Based on those checksum rules and brute force attack, I was able to provide 2 saves with everything unlocked (all images), in bonus the images of the Corocoro comics for pocket camera. See the "Pimp your save" folder. There is an hidden easter egg into the two saves.

# To do next

- Finding a way to un-erase a picture properly (to do) ;
- Finding a way of injecting picture in empty memory slots rather than in active ones (to do).

Here is some hexadecimal porn to end. Changing a byte randomly there is like walking on a mine field.
